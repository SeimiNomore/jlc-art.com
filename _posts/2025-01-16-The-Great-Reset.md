**Art Journal: Developing "The Great Reset"**

<br>

This piece is part of my ongoing *Spooky* collection, a body of work where I explore the delicate tension between the unknown and the transformative power of darkness. Creating "The Great Reset" was an introspective process, one that asked me to confront the fragility of human existence while celebrating its resilience.

The figure, obscured and faceless, emerged almost instinctively—a reflection of the anonymity we sometimes crave in moments of uncertainty. I found myself drawn to the contrasts: the heavy, layered textures of the jacket and the stark void of the surrounding night. The crescent moon, distant yet present, became a silent witness to the narrative—a symbol of cycles, of endings that promise beginnings.

The words "ANTIQUITY" and "RESET" etched onto the surface were deliberate, almost meditative choices. "ANTIQUITY" speaks to the weight of history, the narratives we carry, while "RESET" whispers the possibility of renewal, a clean slate in an unrelenting universe. Together, they create a duality that feels deeply human—our longing to both remember and start over.

Working on "The Great Reset" felt like a reset for me as an artist. It reminded me why I create—to ask questions, to sit in uncertainty, and to discover meaning in the spaces in between.
