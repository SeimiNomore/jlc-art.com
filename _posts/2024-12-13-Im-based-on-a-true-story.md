Art is the core of my passion—an extension of who I am. Though sometimes challenging to articulate, I’ve learned it’s better to let the creative process flow naturally. When I first delved into art journaling, I thought it would be difficult to write freely about my work. To my surprise, the words came effortlessly, as if this practice had been waiting for me all along.

Through this journey, fine art has deepened my introspection and thoughtfulness. Every piece I create starts with a period of reflection—a need to connect with my emotions and understand the meaning behind my work. For me, art is more than expression; it’s a process of uncovering and clarifying my journey. Creating authentically has required me to cleanse and center myself, peeling back layers to reveal what I truly want to bring into existence. I’ve always felt that I needed stability before I could dedicate myself fully to painting. But I’ve realized that true stability is a myth—art itself is my grounding force. This understanding has shaped my personal mythos, helping me evolve into something I hadn’t imagined but always felt within.

My latest collection, “I’m Based on a True Story,” encapsulates this journey. It’s a reflection of my life—a love song told through paint and canvas. This collection carries the essence of love, not limited to one form but evoking the feeling of timeless, old-school ballads, the ache of star-crossed lovers, and the tenderness of connection. Each piece emerges with a sense of something special, carrying the emotions I felt while creating it.

This body of work isn’t just a collection of art; it’s a narrative of love, growth, and becoming. It’s my story, shared through the timeless language of fine art.
