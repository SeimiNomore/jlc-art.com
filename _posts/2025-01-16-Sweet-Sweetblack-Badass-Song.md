**Art Journal Entry: A Parallel in Resilience**

<br>

As I develop my work, I often find myself reflecting on the connections between contemporary narratives and the raw, unpolished truths that echo through history. In this process, I’ve drawn a comparison that feels almost mythical, yet grounded in the lived experience of resilience. 

<br>

Kodak Black comes to mind—not just as an artist, but as a living narrative of struggle, survival, and tenacity. His world, filled with both chaos and creation, mirrors the bruised but unbroken spirit that Melvin Van Peebles captured in *Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song*. There’s an unfiltered honesty in Kodak’s journey that breathes life into the collective tale of overcoming.

When I think about the layers of systemic adversity that both Sweetback and Kodak navigate, I feel a kinship in my own work. Each brushstroke or concept I develop is another thread in a larger tapestry, connecting past and present struggles. It’s not just about capturing resilience—it’s about embodying it. Through my art, I hope to bridge these stories, blending myth with reality and offering a glimpse into the shared experience of perseverance.

In a way, I’m exploring the same uncharted territory they did, finding strength in the imperfections and meaning in the moments that aren’t scripted. There’s beauty in that rawness, and it’s something I strive to carry forward in my own process.
