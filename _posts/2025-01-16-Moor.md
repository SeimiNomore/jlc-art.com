**Moor: Unearthing the Untold**  

As I work on *Moor*, I find myself drawn into the shadows of history—stories that are often overlooked, erased, or misrepresented. This piece is not just an exploration of identity; it’s a conversation with the past, specifically the rich and complex legacy of the Moors, whose influence shaped civilizations but is rarely given its due acknowledgment.  


The figure in the painting emerges as both a symbol and a question. The mask, marked with the word "MOOR," speaks to the hidden nature of their contributions. The Moors, as bearers of knowledge, science, and art, left their mark on Europe and beyond, yet their story remains cloaked in obscurity. The mask, for me, represents both a shield and an enigma—concealing truths while demanding that we look deeper.  


The gold accents—sunglasses, a chain, and a medallion—carry dual meanings. On the surface, they symbolize wealth and opulence, a nod to the splendor of Moorish civilization. But they also hint at the commodification and distortion of history, where richness of culture is reduced to mere aesthetics, stripped of its profound significance.  


The hand gripping a stack of bills introduces a modern tension. It’s a reminder that power, both historical and present, often revolves around economic dominance. It asks: What does it mean to inherit a legacy of brilliance in a world that devalues the depth of its roots?  


The yellow-green background became a deliberate choice—a vibrant, almost surreal landscape that breaks free from the expected. It serves as a reminder that the Moors’ legacy wasn’t confined to one narrative or geography. Their influence was expansive, colorful, and revolutionary, reshaping the very fabric of the world.  


*This* is where the story begins. As an artist, I’m sifting through the fragments of untold history, allowing them to breathe through the work. Every stroke, every mark feels like a bridge between then and now—a way to honor the legacy of the Moors while questioning why their stories remain untold. This piece is unfinished, just like our understanding of history, but perhaps that’s the point. It’s an invitation to uncover, to question, and to remember.
