**The Trumpet as Alignment**  

The trumpet felt like alignment, I thought—a connection between stars and structures, sound and silence. Did Armstrong’s presence in **1961** whisper something beyond music, a resonance tied to the cosmos?  
<br>
I imagined the **Sphinx** watching, timeless and still, guarding a riddle I could feel but not quite grasp. There’s something about that moment—about the interplay of notes and sand—that feels like a cipher waiting to unfold.

This reflection is part of the draft image process for the final piece. The layers of thought and exploration seep into the brushstrokes, guiding the tones and the spaces in between. It’s less about answers and more about holding the tension of the question, letting the mystery shape the work as it moves closer to completion.
